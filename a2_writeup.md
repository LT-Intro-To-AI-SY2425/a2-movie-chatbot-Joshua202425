# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

Some of the % asserts were a bit confusing since I kept getting errors and I didn't know certain functions to help with the match function.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

If someone wanted to find who directed a certain movie, the match function could find the movie in the database by matching the name of the movie and then extracting the name of the director from matching the roles to produce the movie
